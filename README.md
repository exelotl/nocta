nocta
=====

Nocta is an extensible 16-bit synthesis and sound processing library. It can be
used with any audio API that supports signed 16-bit streaming (including maxmod,
SDL, etc.).

All the DSP units are implemented with fixed point arithmetic, so the library
runs super fast. You could use nocta to make your own synth, or to filter the
music in your video game, for example.
